# Discount program 

Write the following in pseudocode:

A local swimming centre offers the following discounts:

- Members who are aged between 13 and 15 receive a 30% discount.
- Members who are aged between 16 and 17 receive a 20% discount.
- Members who are aged 50 and over receive a 40% discount.
- All other members receive no discount. 

Next, write a program that takes your age as input and returns the discount you are entitled to.
