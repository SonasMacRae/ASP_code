# Snake
This is a project that was developed by two third year Computing Science students who had too much spare time.

## What actually is it?
It's a bot that plays a traditional snake game, this application has 2 modes:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## What is the point of this?
I'm glad you asked, the purpose of this is to demonstrate what can be achieved from the knowledge gained at University. This project also shows that you can have fun, it is possible to create projects of your interest and that there is nothing stopping you. 

We have made the code from this project accessible for anyone to look at and play around with.

## How does it work?
Well, the goal for the snake is to eat fruit and avoid death
