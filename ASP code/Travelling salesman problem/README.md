# Travelling salesman problem

(A guide on how to use this application is at the bottom of this README)

The travelling salesman problem is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science. The goal being to visit every location on a map and return to the starting location in the most efficient way. This may be defined by being the fastest, shortest or cheapest path, or a combination of all of these.

This problem is especially useful to demonstrate the power of planning solutions to problems, this activity shows how important it is to not always the best approach to dive head-first into a problem without giving it much thought.

The techniques used to demomnstrate this point are below:

## Environment

For this activity a 100x100 grid is used where locations are stored as (x,y) co-ordinates.

## Brute force method
