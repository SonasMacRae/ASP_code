# Prime numbers challenge (slightly more difficult than the last challenge)

Write a function which will check if an input is a prime number or not.

A prime number is a number that can only be divisible by itself and 1.
examples: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
## For the brave

Now that you have a function which can check if an input is a prime number or not, your next step is to figure out what is the sum of all of the prime numbers below 10,000 whose digits are all prime numbers themselves. 
An example would be '3257' since it is a prime number and all of its digits '3','2','5' and '7' are all prime numbers.

For those of you who have been through and completed some of the examples from https://projecteuler.net this may be trivial.
