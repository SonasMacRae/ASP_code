# Prime numbers challenge (slightly more difficult than the last challenge)

What is the sum of all of the prime numbers below 10,000 whose digits are all prime numbers themselves. 
An example would be '3257' since it is a prime number and all of its digits '3','2','5' and '7' are all prime numbers.

For those of you who have been through and completed some of the examples from https://projecteuler.net this may be trivial. 

## Cheats

Because you may not have enough time to complete this challenge without any help along with the other challenges and activities, code to detect prime numbers in Python is available below.
